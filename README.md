# Getting Started with Naukri-Nest

Welcome to Naukri-Nest, a mobile application designed to assist you in your job search journey! This guide will walk you through setting up and running the project on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js and npm (or yarn):** These tools are essential for managing project dependencies and running Expo commands. You can download and install Node.js (which includes npm) from the official website: https://nodejs.org/.
- **Git (optional, but recommended):** If you plan on contributing to the project or collaborating with others, Git is a version control system that enables efficient code management. You can download Git from https://git-scm.com/.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project. Then, run the following command to clone the Naukri-Nest repository from GitHub:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/m-hisham08/Naukri-Nest.git
   ```

   This will create a local copy of the project named Naukri-Nest.

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Navigate to the project directory using the `cd` command:

   ```bash
   cd Naukri-Nest
   ```

   Then, install the project's dependencies using npm or yarn:

   ```bash
   npm install  # or yarn install
   ```

## Running the Project

1. **Start the Expo Development Server:**

   Run the following command in the terminal to start the Expo development server:

   ```bash
   npm start  # or yarn start
   ```

   This will launch the Expo development server in your browser, typically at `http://localhost:19000/`. You can scan the QR code displayed there with your Expo Go app to view the live application on your device.
